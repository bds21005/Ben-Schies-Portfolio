How's it going guys, starting off the blogging by catching you up on what's been going on in the lab recently. We have been working hard to fine tune some equipment that we just got shipped in.
While the necessary parts aren't in to fully set up our lab, we are definitely getting there! hopefully the rest of our materials will be in by next week and the team can get started on our first project in the new lab! Be sure to stay tuned for more updates to come on that. Thank you for popping in, can't wait to see everyone again next week!
