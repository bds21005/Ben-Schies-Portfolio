A little about me: 

I am a **Senior UConn Physics student**, with a particular interest in **optics research**. I am interested in **acoustic effects on photons travelling through a system**. 

I have worked on a few small projects at the UConn Storrs campus that include ultra cooling, AOM setups, and 3D modelling using CAD. 

While I have a strong background in high energy and optics research, I have other interests, such as a minor in **AstroPhysics**, and a background in **robotics**.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or if you would like to connect:
